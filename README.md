**MonoCode Forms** 
=====================
This project originaly forked from [XLabs-Forms-Labs](https://github.com/XLabs/Xamarin-Forms-Labs) and name changed as "**MonoCode-Forms**". We are following the old bugs from XLabs-Forms Issue page and trying to fix them.  

**MonoCode-Forms** is a open source project that aims to provide a powerful and cross platform set of services and controls tailored to work with Xamarin and [Xamarin Forms](http://xamarin.com/forms).
